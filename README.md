##  Project Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing **Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts using Python.  

The objective is to design real-world systems using classes, objects, constructors, and methods.  
Each problem simulates practical applications used in industries such as:

- Smart Home Automation  
- Corporate HR Systems  
- Mobile Applications  
- Retail & Billing Systems  
- Streaming Platforms  
- Logistics & Delivery Services  

This project demonstrates structured programming and modular design using OOPS principles.

## OOPS Concepts Implemented

-  Classes and Objects  
-  Constructors (`__init__`)  
-  Instance Variables  
-  Object Methods  
-  Encapsulation (Basic Level)  
-  Real-World Modeling using Classes  

## Problems Implemented

### 1. Smart Light Controller
**Description:**  
A class that controls a smart light which can be turned ON or OFF and displays its status.
